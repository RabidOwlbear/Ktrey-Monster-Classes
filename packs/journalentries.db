Lawful Living Statues have a Crystalline, faceted Appearance. Neutral Living Statues appear to be forged from solid Iron. Chaotic Living Statues are covered with a Stony skin-like crust but seethe and churn internally with molten Magma.</p>\n<p>Conventional Lore dictates that Living Statues are created by powerful wizards, but some Sages seem to disagree on these points. Unlike Golems, Living Statues seem to be possessed of free-will, and do not blindly follow the instructions of their “creator.”</p>\n<p>Though magic is obviously involved in bringing them “to life” some speculate they may be more akin to spirits summoned or bound to animate their mineral material, with the Alignment of the Summoner potentially influencing which spirits respond.</p>\n<p>Once animated, Living Statues often outlive those who brought them into being, and sometimes form distinctive societies by type.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"modules/ktrey-monster-classes/img/livingstatue-progression.png\" width=\"800\" height=\"1030\" /></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"PxqQojdX3Ghz8Uq5":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_xla891squh","path":"Monster Class Options","color":"#0000ff"}}}
